                                | iGEM Toronto characterized in detail the decision-making machinery in E. coli that decides between a stationary, low growth state and a mobile, high growth state. We developed a semi-high throughput procedure to measure several biochemical parameters in parallel in a microtiter plate format and characterized wild type and knockout strains, as well as strains that overproduced relevant factors through expression plasmids we had constructed, in a multitude of stimuli conditions.
