                h5 The theory has been learned, the project prepared, and protocols planned, but bringing it all to fruition will present many unexpected challenges. These expert amateur scientists work collaboratively with the dry lab team to successfully construct a plasmid, characterize biobricks, troubleshoot, and produce a viable proof of concept.

                h5 This team of Python loving bioinformatics and computer science enthusiasts aims to create software solutions that work conjointly with the wet lab project. Additionally, through advanced computational modelling, they simulate what can and can’t be done, in order to keep the crazies from the lab bench in check.
