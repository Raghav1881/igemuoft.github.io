Week 2 Update

[@alex?, @heba?, note about progress on species spreadsheet]

[@ghazal, @sean, can you talk about the d3 forced layout app you did, link to codepen]

[@joller can you talk about the FBA you solved, link to lecture pdf on tutorials repo,
and post those lines of MATLAB code here, just use

```
code
    formatted
```

for now] 

[@mark can you talk about FBA stuff, basically repeat what was in that FB 
post of yours]

[@albert can you talk about what you did on the backend this week.
Doesn't even have to include a lot of bio info..talk about what data
structures you used to solve what problem, what the runtime is,
advantages of MongoDB that were used (i.e. ref, populate). think of 
it like a half-assed CSC263 assignment answer.]

[@anyone else, please add anything you think helps describe what
we did this week, and it's relationship to what our next steps are]
